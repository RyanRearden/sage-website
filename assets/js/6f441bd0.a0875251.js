Before joining NIU, I worked for 2 years in a Florida based startup as a research and development manager. There, my role was to design and build computer vision and machine learning based yard management system that automatically tracks the vehicles inside a freight yard.  At NIU, I am deeply interested in solving complex real-life problems by employing computer science tools and techniques, especially artificial intelligence and computer vision. While working at Argonne National Lab in summer 2020, I worked on to design and build an AI-enabled computer vision system that counts the pedestrians who violate the crosswalk while crossing the street. The goal of this project is 3-fold; first \u2013 detect every pedestrian in the image, second \u2013 re-identify the pedestrian in successive frames to avoid their recounting, third \u2013 count the pedestrians who do not follow the crosswalk. A sample output image from the project is shown in Figure 1.",date:"2021-02-12T00:00:00.000Z",tags:[{label:"AI applications",permalink:"/news/tags/ai-applications"},{label:"NIU",permalink:"/news/tags/niu"}],readingTime:10.01,hasTruncateMarker:!0,authors:[{name:"Pratool Bharti",title:"Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University",url:"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/",imageURL:"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/images/profile.png"}],frontMatter:{title:"Pedestrian Count for Crosswalk Violations",author:"Pratool Bharti",author_title:"Assistant Professor, Dept. of Computer Science, Northern Illinois University",author_url:"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/",author_image_url:"https://pratoolbharti.github.io/NIU/images/profile.png",tags:["AI applications","NIU"]},unlisted:!1,prevItem:{title:"Sage Neon deployment to the Konza LTER site in Kansas",permalink:"/news/sage-neon-deploy-konza"},nextItem:{title:"Argonne's Big Data Camp Goes Virtual",permalink:"/news/big-data"}},l={authorsImageUrls:[void 0]},p=[];function c(e){const t={p:"p",...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Hi, I am Pratool Bharti, an assistant professor in Computer Science department at Northern Illinois University (NIU).
