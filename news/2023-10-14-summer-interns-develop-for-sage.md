# Summer Interns Develop Next Generation Edge Applications for Sage

The summer 2023 intern projects were filled with exciting and impactful science that truly pushed the boundaries of edge computing. This standout work includes using AI for: snow detection on the Bad River, utilizing image super-resolution, estimating solar irradiance, automating rideshare vehicle detection, lightning detection with software defined radio, smoke & wildfire detection, and building an API for Waggle infrastructure. The interns came together from a wide variety of STEM backgrounds, experiences, and universities to bring new insights into the novel applications they developed. Each intern left with a deeper understanding of various fundamental concepts of Sage - software-defined sensor networks, edge computing, and machine learning.
